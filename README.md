# TMC2130 Hardware Library

This repository hosts a hardware library for BIGTREETECH's TMC2130 stepper motor driver module, compatible with Eagle / Fusion360 CAD software. The library includes schematic symbols, PCB footprints, and an associated 3D model to facilitate the design and implementation of the TMC2130 in electronic projects.

## 3D Model

The 3D model is sourced from the following GrabCAD community library, which provides a detailed representation of the SilentStepStick TMC2130 module for use in mechanical and electronic CAD designs:
